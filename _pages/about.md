Hi, Iâ€™m **Oliver Grainge** â€“ a researcher and engineer passionate about machine intelligence, computer vision, and NLP. My work is driven by a noâ€‘nonsense, dataâ€‘driven approach that prioritizes efficient, scalable, and robust solutions for realâ€‘world problems.

## About My Research

Iâ€™m currently immersed in projects that explore:

* **Ternary Quantized Neural Networks:** Developing training methods and deployment tools for ternary (âˆ’1,â€¯0,â€¯+1) networks that deliver stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art accuracy on resourceâ€‘constrained hardware.
* **Lowâ€‘Bit Quantized Neural Networks:** Extending binary and other subâ€‘8â€‘bit quantization techniques to enable deep learning at the edge.
* **Efficient Neural Network Compression:** Researching structured pruning and quantization strategies to optimize visual place recognition systems without compromising performance.
* **Advanced Model Optimization:** Investigating pruning strategies and neural network compression techniques that reduce latency and memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy.

My work has been recognized in peerâ€‘reviewed venues such as *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters* and through successful collaborations with industry partners including **Fosterâ€¯+â€¯Partners** and **Arm**, where Iâ€™ve delivered practical lowâ€‘bit solutions for commercial and embedded AI platforms.
