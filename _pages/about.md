# Welcome to my academic space ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m **Oliver Grainge** â€“ a researcher and engineer passionate about machine intelligence, computer vision, and NLP. My work is driven by a no-nonsense, data-driven approach that prioritizes efficient, scalable, and robust solutions for real-world problems.

## About My Research
Iâ€™m currently immersed in projects that explore:
- **Low-Bit Quantized Neural Networks:** Developing methods for low-bit quantization (binary and ternary) to enable deep learning on resource-constrained devices.
- **Efficient Neural Network Compression:** Researching structured pruning and quantization techniques to optimize visual place recognition systems without compromising performance.
- **Advanced Model Optimization:** Investigating pruning strategies and neural network compression techniques that reduce latency and memory footprint while maintaining high accuracy.

My work has been recognized in publications such as IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, where Iâ€™ve detailed methods for structured pruning and design space exploration of low-bit quantized networks.
