        <h1>VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>VSLAM</strong> is a streamlined Python implementation of Stereo Visual SLAM.
          Utilizing libraries such as <strong>numpy</strong>, <strong>opencv</strong>, and <strong>scipy</strong>,
          it performs feature detection, tracking, matching, motion estimation, and optimization—all designed with the
          <strong>KITTI dataset</strong> in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project includes demo scripts that illustrate essential processes in the visual SLAM pipeline,
          providing an accessible platform for research and experimentation in visual localization and mapping.
        </p>
