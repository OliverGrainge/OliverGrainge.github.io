    <h1>VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>VSLAM</strong> is a streamlined Python implementation of Stereo Visual SLAM.
      Utilizing libraries such as <strong>numpy</strong>, <strong>opencv</strong>, and <strong>scipy</strong>,
      it performs feature detection, tracking, matching, motion estimation, and optimizationâ€”all designed with the
      <strong>KITTI dataset</strong> in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project includes demo scripts that illustrate essential processes in the visual SLAM pipeline,
      providing an accessible platform for research and experimentation in visual localization and mapping.
