# VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

**VSLAM** is a streamlined Python implementation of Stereo Visual SLAM. Utilizing libraries such as **numpy**, **opencv**, and **scipy**, it performs feature detection, tracking, matching, motion estimation, and optimizationâ€”all designed with the **KITTI dataset** in mind.

The project includes demo scripts that illustrate essential processes in the visual SLAM pipeline, providing an accessible platform for research and experimentation in visual localization and mapping.
